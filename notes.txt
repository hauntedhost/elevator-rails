whats the problem?

i have the ability to spawn separate jobs that are both running simultaneously every second. note: i also may only need to spawn a single dispatch job that runs every second forever.

so what do these jobs do?
1. increment elevator position
2. check for requests between current floor and next destination
  how to check if another is closer tho?
  two checks:
    * calls between my location and next destination
    * cabs that are closer than me and available
3. 

maybe we have an elevator model with elevators
  position: 1.5 | direction: down
  position: 5.4 | direction: up

up/down requests are submitted as post requests to calls#create
from_floor: 3
direction: up

what does dispatch controller do with this information?
####it looks at the elevators in the database
it adds the request to the requests database

models:
cabs
calls

cabs:
current_floor: decimal
direction: [up, down, none]
status: [idle, transit]

calls:
from_floor: 3
direction: up
cab_id: 1
status: [active, complete]  # unassigned, assigned,
