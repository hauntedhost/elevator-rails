Elevator Algorithm
==================

Using the language(s) of your choice, create an Elevator System class that manages all the elevators in a highrise. The behavior of the cars in response to button pushes can be any reasonable scheme of your own defining. For example, if someone on the fifth floor pushes the “down” button, what are the factors that will determine which car or cars are sent to service that request? You can come up with your own spec that answers such questions. Our main interest is in seeing your design and implementation for meeting that spec.

Notes:
------

1. Feel free to create additional classes and internal objects; whatever you feel you need to model the elevator system well.

2. The code doesn't need to be complete if you don't have the time. We're interested first in your design, and then in your algorithmic sense. The priorities are: class hierarchy and object model, public interfaces, major member variables, important private methods, implementations. However, every major method of every major class should at least have a pseudo code implementation that explains what that method would actually do. Also, at least one complicated method should be implemented in real code, as we’re also interested in your coding style.

3. Assume that you’ll have an API for sending commands to the physical cars themselves and for receiving notifications about things like button presses on the floors and in the cars and the current positions and movement of the cars. Go ahead and define how you’d want that API to look and what you’d want it to do for you. You won’t have to implement any of these functions, of course.
